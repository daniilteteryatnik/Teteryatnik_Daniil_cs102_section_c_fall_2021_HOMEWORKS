// This is a program that first declares the integers min, h, and minute. Then it will ask the user to "Enter the minutes:".  It will then define "min" using an input from the user via STDIO. Next, the program defines h as being min divided by 60. (Since we declared h as an integer, when the program does division it will find the number of times 60 fully goes into "min" and disregard the remainder.) Next the program defines "minutes" as "min" minus ("h" times 60). (This is the same as finding the remainder of "min" divided by 60.) The program then prints out H = the integer value of "h", and Minutes = the integer value of "minute".
