//First the program defines the global variables DOLLAR as 100, QUARTER as 25, DIME as 10, and NICKEL as 5. Next, in function main the program declares the integers "dollars", "quarters", "dimes", "nickels", and "pennies", which it initializes as all equal to zero. Next the program declares the integer "amount". The program then ask the user to enter the amount they want in cents and takes the user's input using scanf via STDIO. Next, if the amount is greater then the program will divide the amount by DOLLAR to get the integer amount of dollars that will be in your change. The remainder of that is now defined as the amount. If the amount is now greater than 25 the program will find how many quarters will fit into the amount, then it defines the amount as the remainder. So on and so forth for the dimes, nickels, and pennies. The program will then print out the minimum amount of dollars and coins you should use to make the amount that you input in cents.
