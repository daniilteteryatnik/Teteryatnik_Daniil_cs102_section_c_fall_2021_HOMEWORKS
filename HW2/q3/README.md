    //First the program will declare the float "a", the int "b", and defines char "c". Next it declares "a" = 1.55, "b" = 1. Next the program tries to print the float "a" as an integer, this spits out a warning that you're using the wrong type of format specifier. Next the program tries to print the integer "b" as a float, this also spits out a warning that you're using the wrong type of format specifier. (With only the two previously mentioned printf statements in place the code works and prints out the correct values.) Next the program will try to print the char "c" as an integer. (This seems to break the code and make it no longer print out anything besides the warnings.)
